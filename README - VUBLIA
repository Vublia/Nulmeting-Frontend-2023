### FILLING IN THE API KEY
Fill in the API key in todo.ts,  in the apiCall function  (the variable config). OR create a file named apiKey.js in the root with a function 'getAPIkey()' which returns your api key.

### WHERE TO FIND CODE I WROTE
I left the about.vue and index.vue untouched (except a button that sends you to the page for the nulmeting). The page for the nulmeting is cooltable.vue, and corresponding store is todo.ts

### OTHER THINGS
There are a lot of warnings on my side but it does run fine 
  (Warnings related to deprecated packages)

I also used `npm i sass` to install sass, as the one in the documents failed me. Hopefully that isn't a problem
